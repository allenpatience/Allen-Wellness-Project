           <h4><strong>A Few Exercises That Can Help To Improve Balance and Stabilty.</strong></h4>
           <p>For example, exercises like single-leg stands, heel-to-toe walking, and side leg raises can improve balance and stability for seniors. Other beneficial activities include chair squats, marching in place, and specific practices like Tai Chi and yoga. It is recommended to start with support from a chair or wall and practice for at least 5 minutes a day.</p>

                 <h5 class="card-title">Single-leg stands</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Single leg stands build strength and balance by strengthening the muscles in the supporting leg, such as the quadriceps, glutes, 
                       and hamstrings, and by enhancing proprioception (your body's awareness of its position in space). This exercise requires the muscles 
                     to work harder to maintain posture, improving both muscular endurance and the coordination between your eyes, ears, and muscles. 
                      This practice directly improves stability, coordination, and the ability to recover from stumbles, which helps prevent falls in daily life.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Heel-to-toe walking improves balance by forcing your body to shift weight and engage stabilizing muscles to maintain a narrow base of support.
                       It enhances strength by challenging your leg and core muscles to work harder to control each step and hold your posture. This exercise also improves proprioception, 
                       which is your body's awareness of its position in space, helping to prevent trips and falls.

            <p>
                Side leg raises benefit the elderly by strengthening hip, thigh, and glute muscles, which improves overall stability and balance, 
                helping to reduce the risk of falls. This exercise also enhances lower body mobility, posture, and the ability to perform daily 
                activities more easily.

            <h3> <strong>NUTRITION TIPS FOR HEALTHY AGING</strong></h3>

            <p>
                For healthy aging, focus on nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy, 
                while limiting empty calories from sugar, salt, and saturated/trans fats. Stay hydrated and prioritize protein to maintain muscle mass, 
                calcium and vitamin D for bone health, and omega-3 fatty acids for brain and heart health.
